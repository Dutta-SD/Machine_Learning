## About
This repository is for storing code for Machine Learning Codes:
* **Model with Outliers - Source Code for Medium Article** [[link to article]](https://sandip-dutta.medium.com/some-regression-techniques-with-outliers-d69361c74726)
  * Contains Jupyter notebook for Robust Estimators, that is ML models robust to outliers
    * Theil Sen Estimator
    * Huber Regression
* **qsar_oral_toxicity - To predict the toxicity of oral compounds** [[link to dataset]](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/QSAR+oral+toxicity#)
  * Fixed Imbalance using SMOTETomek Technique
  * Used Logistic Regression to predict the toxicity. Achieved a f score of 0.93
* **Churn_Modelling - To predict if customer will churn (that is leave the comapny or not)**
  * Cleaned the datasets and Imputed values
  * Applied various models and predicted the score. 
  * Implemented Neural Network model using Keras for prediction.
  * Final accuracy came out to be about `89%`
* **Classification - Contains file for classification tasks.**
  * Applied models on Diabetes Dataset and Loan prediction dataset.
  * Reached about 80% accuracy.
* **Dimensionality Reduction - For Understanding Data Compression techniques**
  * Short file for Understanding PCA and implementation
* **Parkinsons - Parkinsons Disease Prediction**
  * Prediction of Parkinsons Disease using XgBoost
  * Achieved an accuracy of over 95%
* **SAT_Score - Prediction of SAT Score of Students**
  * Regression model for predicting the Scores of Students
